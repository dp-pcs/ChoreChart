# Multiple Parents Support Implementation

## Overview

We have successfully implemented comprehensive support for multiple parents in the ChoreChart application. This feature enables co-parenting scenarios where children can belong to multiple families and parents can manage chores across different households.

## Key Features Implemented

### 🏗️ Database Schema Changes

**New `FamilyMembership` Model:**
- Users can now belong to multiple families with different roles and permissions
- Each membership has configurable permissions (invite, manage, approve)
- Primary family designation for default context
- Active/inactive status for managing membership lifecycle

**Enhanced `Family` Model:**
- `allowMultipleParents`: Toggle to enable/disable multiple parent functionality
- `shareReports`: Allow sharing reports across co-parenting families
- `crossFamilyApproval`: Enable parents from other families to approve chores

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Existing users are automatically migrated to the new system
- Original family relationships are preserved as primary memberships

### 📡 API Endpoints

**Family Membership Management:**
- `GET /api/memberships` - Get user's family memberships
- `POST /api/memberships` - Join a family (via invite)
- `POST /api/memberships/switch` - Switch active family context
- `PATCH /api/memberships/[id]` - Update membership permissions
- `DELETE /api/memberships/[id]` - Leave or remove from family

**Multi-Family Data Filtering:**
- All existing endpoints now support family context switching
- Cross-family approval capabilities for co-parenting scenarios

### 🖼️ User Interface Components

**Family Switcher Component:**
- Dropdown selector for users with multiple family memberships
- Visual indicators for primary family and user roles
- Permission badges showing user capabilities in each family
- Co-parenting status indicator when multiple families are active

**Enhanced Authentication:**
- Session management supports active family context
- Role-based permissions per family membership

### 🔧 Utility Functions

**Multi-Family Helper Functions:**
- `getPrimaryFamily()` - Get user's primary family
- `hasPermission()` - Check permissions across families
- `getFamiliesByRole()` - Filter families by user role
- `canApproveInFamily()` - Check approval permissions

## Implementation Details

### Database Migration

```sql
-- New FamilyMembership table
CREATE TABLE family_memberships (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  userId TEXT NOT NULL,
  familyId TEXT NOT NULL,
  role TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (role IN ('PARENT', 'CHILD')),
  isActive BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  isPrimary BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  canInvite BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  canManage BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  permissions TEXT, -- JSON object
  createdAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  UNIQUE(userId, familyId)
);

-- Enhanced Family table with co-parenting settings
ALTER TABLE families ADD COLUMN allowMultipleParents BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;
ALTER TABLE families ADD COLUMN shareReports BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE families ADD COLUMN crossFamilyApproval BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
```

### API Usage Examples

**Getting User's Families:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/memberships');
const { data: memberships } = await response.json();
// Returns array of FamilyMembership objects with family details
```

**Switching Family Context:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/memberships/switch', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ familyId: 'family-abc-123' })
});
```

**Using the Family Switcher Component:**
```tsx
import { FamilySwitcher } from '@/components/ui/family-switcher';

function ParentDashboard() {
  const handleFamilySwitch = (familyId: string) => {
    // Refresh dashboard data for new family context
    console.log('Switched to family:', familyId);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <FamilySwitcher onFamilySwitch={handleFamilySwitch} />
      {/* Rest of dashboard */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Co-Parenting Scenarios Supported

### 1. **Basic Co-Parenting**
- Child lives with divorced parents in separate households
- Each parent has their own ChoreChart family
- Child is a member of both families with same role
- Parents can approve chores in their respective families

### 2. **Shared Custody with Cross-Approval**
- Parents can approve chores from either household
- Configurable via `crossFamilyApproval` family setting
- Maintains accountability across households

### 3. **Blended Families**
- Step-parents can be added as additional parents
- Different permission levels (can invite, can manage)
- Flexible role assignments per family

### 4. **Extended Family Support**
- Grandparents or guardians as additional parent figures
- Temporary care arrangements
- Permission-based access control

## Demo Data

**Created demo accounts for testing:**
- `parent@demo.com` / `password` - Original family parent
- `child@demo.com` / `password` - Child in both families
- `coparent@demo.com` / `password` - Co-parent in second family

**Demo families:**
1. "The Demo Family" - Original family
2. "The Johnson Co-Parents" - Co-parenting family

## Migration Script

Run the migration script to populate existing users:
```bash
cd web
npx tsx scripts/migrate-to-multiple-families.ts
```

This script:
- ✅ Creates FamilyMembership records for existing users
- ✅ Sets up proper permissions based on existing roles
- ✅ Designates existing memberships as primary
- ✅ Updates family settings to allow multiple parents
- ✅ Creates demo co-parenting data

## Testing the Feature

### 1. **Test Family Switching**
- Log in as `child@demo.com`
- Use the Family Switcher component to toggle between families
- Verify chores and data update based on active family

### 2. **Test Co-Parent Approval**
- Log in as `coparent@demo.com`
- Submit chores as the child in the co-parent family
- Switch to parent account and approve chores

### 3. **Test Permission Levels**
- Verify different permission badges in Family Switcher
- Test invite/manage capabilities based on permissions

## Security Considerations

### ✅ **Access Control**
- Users can only access families they're members of
- Role-based permissions enforced at API level
- Family switching requires valid membership verification

### ✅ **Data Isolation**
- Chores and data filtered by active family context
- Cross-family data sharing only when explicitly enabled
- Audit trail for family membership changes

### ✅ **Privacy Protection**
- Reports sharing configurable per family
- Optional cross-family approval features
- Clear indication of active family context

## Next Steps for Enhancement

### 🚀 **Phase 2 Features**
1. **Family Invitation System**
   - Email invitations to join families
   - Invitation codes for secure joining
   - Approval workflow for family additions

2. **Advanced Permission Management**
   - Granular permissions per family member
   - Time-limited permissions (temporary guardianship)
   - Permission inheritance from family settings

3. **Cross-Family Reporting**
   - Combined reports across all families
   - Parent communication tools
   - Shared calendar integration

4. **Mobile App Integration**
   - Family switching in React Native app
   - Push notifications per family context
   - Offline family context management

### 🔧 **Technical Improvements**
1. **Session Management**
   - Persistent family context in sessions
   - Automatic family switching based on context
   - Enhanced JWT token with family information

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Cached family membership queries
   - Efficient family context switching
   - Optimized cross-family data loading

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - WebSocket connections per family
   - Live family switching notifications
   - Real-time cross-family approval updates
