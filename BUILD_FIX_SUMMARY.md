# Build Fix Summary

## Issue
The AWS Amplify build failed with the error:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/ui/textarea'
```

## Root Cause
The commit `52603f6` that was being deployed included new scoring system features that were missing dependencies and database schema changes.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Missing UI Component ✅
**Problem:** `chore-scoring-dialog.tsx` was importing a non-existent `textarea` component
**Solution:** Created `web/src/components/ui/textarea.tsx` following the same pattern as other UI components

### 2. Missing Database Schema Fields ✅
**Problem:** TypeScript errors due to missing `score` and `partialReward` fields in database models
**Solution:** Updated Prisma schema to add missing fields:

#### ChoreSubmission Model
```prisma
model ChoreSubmission {
  // ... existing fields
  score         Int?
  partialReward Int?
  // ... rest of model
}
```

#### ChoreApproval Model  
```prisma
model ChoreApproval {
  // ... existing fields
  score          Int?
  partialReward  Int?
  originalReward Int?
  // ... rest of model
}
```

### 3. Generated Updated Prisma Client ✅
**Action:** Ran `npx prisma generate` to update TypeScript types with new schema fields

### 4. Created Migration Script ✅
**File:** `web/scripts/add-scoring-system-schema.ts`
**Purpose:** Safely apply database schema changes in production environment

## Verification
✅ Build now passes successfully: `npm run build` completes without errors
✅ All TypeScript type checking passes
✅ New scoring system features are properly integrated

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. The migration script should be run during the Amplify build process
2. Consider adding the script to the build phase in `amplify.yml` if needed
3. Verify database connectivity and schema updates in production

## Files Modified
- `web/src/components/ui/textarea.tsx` (created)
- `web/prisma/schema.prisma` (updated)
- `web/scripts/add-scoring-system-schema.ts` (created)

The codebase is now ready for successful deployment.
