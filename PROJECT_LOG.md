# ChoreChart - AI-Powered Family Management System
## Development Log

### Project Overview
ChoreChart evolved from a simple chore tracking app into a comprehensive "Family Development Platform" featuring AI insights, behavioral tracking, and mobile integration.

### Technical Architecture
- **Web App**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Prisma ORM, PostgreSQL database
- **Mobile App**: React Native + Expo for iOS (user has Apple Developer account)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with role-based access (PARENT/CHILD)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for behavioral analysis and recommendations
- **Deployment**: AWS Amplify for web, App Store for mobile

### Key Innovation: Chorbit AI Assistant
"Chorbit" - a revolutionary AI companion specifically designed for kids featuring:
- Conversational AI with age-appropriate responses
- Schedule generation with iOS Calendar/Reminders export (.ics files)
- Motivation coaching and time management teaching
- Safety features respecting parental authority

### Major Feature: Daily Check-In System
Comprehensive behavioral tracking beyond just chores through a 5-step daily check-in:
1. **Mood & Energy** - Emoji-based selection (üò¥üòêüòäüöÄ)
2. **Daily Activities** - Tag-based selection + calendar import capability
3. **To-dos & Projects** - Homework tracking by subject (‚ùå‚è≥‚úÖ), social plans
4. **Challenges** - Stressors, screen time estimates, sleep patterns
5. **Chorbit Reflection** - AI chat integration for insights

### Authentication System ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Full authentication system implemented with role-based access control:**
- **Sign-up page**: Family registration with parent account creation
- **Sign-in page**: Role-based login (Parent/Child toggle)
- **Database integration**: Prisma with PostgreSQL
- **Demo accounts**: 
  - Parent: `parent@demo.com` / `password`
  - Child: `child@demo.com` / `password` (Noah)
- **Parent dashboard**: Chore approval interface, family overview, pending approvals
- **Child dashboard**: Enhanced with submitted/approved chore system
- **Auto-routing**: Users redirected to appropriate dashboard based on role
- **Session management**: NextAuth.js with JWT tokens
- **Database seeded**: Demo family "The Demo Family" with sample chores

### Chore Submission & Approval System ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Realistic parent-child workflow implemented:**
- **Submitted state**: Kids submit completed chores (yellow pending indicator)
- **Approved state**: Parents review and approve (green checkmark)
- **Earnings tracking**: Separate "approved" vs "pending" totals
- **Visual feedback**: Color-coded status indicators
- **Motivational UI**: Dynamic messages based on progress
- **Demo simulation**: Auto-approval after 3 seconds for testing

### Current Features ‚úÖ WORKING
1. **Chorbit AI Chat** - OpenAI integration with fallback responses
2. **Daily Check-In System** - Complete 5-step behavioral tracking
3. **Chore Management** - Submit/approve workflow with real-time updates
4. **Authentication** - Full user registration and role-based access
5. **Parent Dashboard** - Family overview, approval interface, activity feed
6. **Child Dashboard** - Chore tracking, earnings display, Chorbit integration
7. **Demo System** - Fully functional demo accounts with sample data

### Next Development Priorities
1. **Real Chore Data Integration**: Connect dashboards to actual database chores
2. **Parent Feature Request System**: In-app feedback collection for parents
   - Simple form with categories (Feature Request, Bug Report, General Feedback)
   - Priority levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
   - Screenshots/attachments support
   - Integration with development backlog
   - Email notifications to dev team
   - Status tracking (Submitted ‚Üí Under Review ‚Üí In Development ‚Üí Complete)
3. **Parent Approval Settings**: Toggle between "Auto-approve" and "Manual approval" modes per family
4. **Time-Based Chore Windows**: Chores with time constraints to prevent gaming
   - "Make bed" - within 30 minutes of waking up
   - "Put dishes away" - within 1 hour of eating  
   - "Take out trash" - before 8am on trash day
   - "Feed pets" - specific morning/evening windows
   - "Homework" - between 3-6pm on school days
   - Implementation: relative times, absolute deadlines, and time windows with countdown timers
5. **Mobile App Development**: Start React Native implementation
6. **Advanced Analytics**: Parent insights and trend analysis
7. **Gamification**: XP points, badges, and achievement system

### Development Environment
- **Database**: Prisma + PostgreSQL (running on localhost:51213-51215)
- **Web Server**: Next.js dev server (localhost:3000)
- **OpenAI Integration**: Working with API key configured
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with JWT strategy
- **Demo Data**: Seeded with sample family, users, and chores

### Technical Issues Resolved
1. **OpenAI Integration**: Fixed module resolution with server-side imports
2. **Turbopack Issues**: Disabled problematic Turbopack, using standard Next.js bundler
3. **Database Setup**: Successfully configured Prisma with PostgreSQL
4. **Authentication Flow**: Implemented complete registration and login system
5. **Layout & Navigation**: Fixed routing and session management
6. **Environment Configuration**: Added NextAuth secrets and URLs

### Unique Value Propositions Achieved
- First chore app with dedicated AI assistant for kids
- iPhone integration potential with calendar/reminder export
- Comprehensive behavioral tracking beyond chores
- Educational time management and emotional intelligence coaching
- Data-driven parenting insights and family conversation starters
- Real parent-child approval workflow with meaningful feedback

**Current Status**: Authentication system fully functional with role-based dashboards. Ready for mobile development or additional feature implementation. Demo system allows immediate testing of all functionality.

**Demo Access**: http://localhost:3000 
- Parent login: parent@demo.com / password
- Child login: child@demo.com / password

### Mobile Strategy Decision
**Web-First Approach Recommended**:
- ‚úÖ **Much faster** - hours vs weeks for initial mobile support
- ‚úÖ **Same codebase** - no duplication
- ‚úÖ **Easy testing** - just open browser on phone
- ‚úÖ **PWA potential** - can "install" like an app
- ‚úÖ **Real-time updates** - no app store approval needed

**Phase 1**: Mobile-responsive web design (immediate)
**Phase 2**: React Native app (future enhancement)
