- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for behavioral analysis and recommendations
- **Deployment**: AWS Amplify for web, App Store for mobile
- **PWA Support**: Installable web app with mobile-first design

### Key Innovation: Chorbit AI Assistant
"Chorbit" - a revolutionary AI companion specifically designed for kids featuring:
- Conversational AI with age-appropriate responses
- Schedule generation with iOS Calendar/Reminders export (.ics files)
- Motivation coaching and time management teaching
- Safety features respecting parental authority

### Major Feature: Daily Check-In System
Comprehensive behavioral tracking beyond just chores through a 5-step daily check-in:
1. **Mood & Energy** - Emoji-based selection (üò¥üòêüòäüöÄ)
2. **Daily Activities** - Tag-based selection + calendar import capability
3. **To-dos & Projects** - Homework tracking by subject (‚ùå‚è≥‚úÖ), social plans
4. **Challenges** - Stressors, screen time estimates, sleep patterns
5. **Chorbit Reflection** - AI chat integration for insights

### Advanced Chore Management System
**Submit/Approve Workflow:**
