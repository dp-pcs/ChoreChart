# Configuration for Chorbit AI

To enable the full AI capabilities of Chorbit, add your OpenAI API key to the .env file:

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here

Without this key, Chorbit will use intelligent fallback responses that are still engaging but not AI-powered.

Get your API key from: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
