# Chore Quality Scoring System

## Overview

The new scoring system allows parents to evaluate the quality of their children's work and award partial rewards based on performance. This encourages better work habits and teaches the value of doing things right the first time.

## Features

### For Parents

1. **Quality Scoring**: Rate chore completion from 0-100%
2. **Partial Rewards**: Automatically calculate rewards based on quality score
3. **Feedback System**: Provide specific feedback for improvement
4. **Visual Interface**: Intuitive slider-based scoring with real-time calculations

### For Children

1. **Quality Feedback**: See detailed scoring breakdown
2. **Improvement Tips**: Get constructive suggestions for better work
3. **Transparent Rewards**: Understand exactly how rewards are calculated
4. **Motivational Design**: Encouraging feedback for good work

## How It Works

### Scoring Scale

- **90-100%**: üåü Excellent work - Full reward
- **70-89%**: üëç Good job - Partial reward  
- **50-69%**: ü§î Needs improvement - Reduced reward
- **0-49%**: üòû Poor quality - Minimal or no reward

### Reward Calculation

```
Final Reward = (Quality Score / 100) √ó Original Reward
```

**Example**: A $10 chore with 75% quality score = $7.50 reward
