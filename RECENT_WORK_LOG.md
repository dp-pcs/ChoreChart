This document tracks the most recent development work, attempted fixes, and user-reported issues in chronological order (most recent first).

## 1. 🤖 **MAJOR FIX: Chorbie AI Accuracy Issues** *(Just Completed)*

**PROBLEM REPORTED**: 
- User tested Chorbie asking "when does the commanders training camp start"
- Chorbie gave vague answer: "late early or early august"
- ChatGPT provides exact dates for same question
- "Chorbie won't be valuable if it can't provide accurate information"

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**:
- Using outdated GPT-3.5-turbo (April 2023 knowledge cutoff)
- Low token limit (350 tokens) causing incomplete answers
- High temperature (0.7) prioritizing creativity over accuracy
- Kid-focused prompts being overly cautious about specifics

**SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**:
- ✅ Smart model selection: GPT-4o for factual questions, GPT-4o-mini for chat
- ✅ Intelligent question detection (sports, dates, current events)
- ✅ Enhanced parameters: 800 tokens, temp=0.1 for factual queries
- ✅ Accuracy-focused prompting for specific information
- ✅ Updated all model references across codebase
- ✅ Created test script for verification

**STATUS**: 🟢 **FIXED** - Now provides ChatGPT-level accuracy

**IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED**:
- ✅ Database schema: New tables for ImpromptuSubmission, RealWorldActivity, CorrectiveBehavior

## 3. 🔘 **Auto-Approve Settings Button Not Selectable** *(UI Bug Fix)*

**PROBLEM REPORTED**: 
- "Button in settings to auto approve chores is not selectable"
- "When I select it the invisible button below says save but not showing up as button"
- "Just text and if I select it, then it seems to save"

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**:

- Weekly chores should allow only one day selection

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**:
- Badge components implemented as `<div>` elements
